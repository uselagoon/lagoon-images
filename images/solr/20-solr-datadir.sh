# Previously the Solr Config and Solr Data Dir was both kept in the persistent volume:
# - Solr data: /opt/solr/server/solr/mycores/${corename}/data
# - Solr config: /opt/solr/server/solr/mycores/${corename}/config
# - Persistent Volume: /opt/solr/server/solr/mycores/
# The Solr Config was copied from the Docker Image into the Solr Config directory on the very first time solr started.
# This had the problem that if a new Solr Config was shipped in a new Docker Iamage the config was not copied again.
# Therefore there was no possibility to ship with updated configs and also the system does not follow any other
# services like nginx or php which have their configs not existing in persistent volumes and insted in Docker Images.
# The following script migrates from to the new directory structure:
# - Solr data: /var/solr/${corename}
# - Solr config: /opt/solr/server/solr/mycores/${corename}/config
# - Persistent Volume: /var/solr/
# It does:
# 1. Move folders from /var/solr/${corename}/data to /var/solr/${corename} - this is needed if the existing persistent volume is
#    mounted now to /var/solr/ but the data is still within data/
# 2. Create the folder /opt/solr/server/solr/mycores/${corename} if not existing (because there is no persistent volume mounted anymore)
#    and copy the config from the persistent storage to that folder.

# It then also tries to update existing non-compatible configs inside solrconfig.xml:
# - dataDir now needs to be `<dataDir>/var/solr/${solr.core.name}</dataDir>` to point to the new persistent Volume
# - lockType needs to be `<lockType>${solr.lock.type:none}</lockType>` to prevent issues with the default file based Lock system which
#   can cause issues if the solr is not stopped correctly
# The script does that for existing configs in `/opt/solr/server/solr/mycores/${corename}/config` if that folder exists which can be on two cases:
# 1. During a docker build the solr core has already been created via `precreate-core` (which should be used now all the time)
# 2. The first part of the script has copied the config from the previous persistent volume into these folders
# If `/opt/solr/server/solr/mycores` is empty, this means the container has never been started, had no previous persistent volume and also did not
# run `precreate-core` yet, it checks if the common used folder `/solr-conf/conf/` has a config in it and tries to adapt it.
# This probably fails because of permissions issues, it will throw an error and exit.
